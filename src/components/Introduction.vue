          There are currently an estimated 2.3 million individuals in U.S. prisons and jails, with 1.5 million meeting DSM-IV medical criteria for addiction (NIDA, 2014; CASA, 2010). Further, approximately 70 percent of state and 64 percent of federal inmates reported regular drug use prior to imprisonment; about 25 percent of violent offenders in state prisons committed their offenses under the influence of drugs (NIDA, 2014).

          <p>Spending-wise, 74 billion dollars was spent by federal, state, and local governments in 2005 for incarceration, court processing, and community-supervision of offenders with substance use disorders, and only 632 million spent on prevention and treatment (CASA, 2010). In addition, of incarcerated offenders with substance use disorders, only 11 percent actually received any treatment (CASA, 2010), proving it vital for the criminal justice system to incorporate avenues for substance buse treatment and diversion.

          <p>Regarding Illinois, drug offenses accounted for 99,953 arrests in 2015 (Illinois State Police, 2015). Moreover, Illinois is experiencing a widespread heroin and opioid epidemic. Heroin-related deaths rose from 149 to 681 between 2010 and 2014, with significant increases in Cook County (CDC Opioid Overdose State Data, 2016).
            <p>In response, criminal justice system, public health professionals, and legislators have tried to increase access to substance abuse treatment, inducing harm reduction tactics, and reduce influx of drugs in the community that contributes to abuse, addiction, and overdose.</p> <p>This timeline explores criminal justice responses intended to deflect and/or divert individuals with substance use disorders from further involvement in the criminal justice system.
