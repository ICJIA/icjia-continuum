# ICJIA Reducing Substance Use Disorders and Related Offending: A Continuum of Evidence-Informed Practices in the Criminal Justice System

>There are more than 20 million individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs) in the
United States (Office of the Surgeon General, 2016), a subset of whom are involved
with the criminal justice system. Seventy-eight percent of violent crimes and 77
percent of property crimes involve drugs and/or alcohol (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, 2016). More than half of the 2.2 million individuals housed in U.S.
prisons and jails meet the clinical diagnosis criteria for SUDs. The government spends
an estimated $74 billion dollars on court processing, community-supervision, and
imprisonment of individuals with SUDs (National Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse, 2010).

> Over the past several decades, research and rigorous evaluation has provided insight
on effective practices for individuals with substance use disorders (SUD) and the
importance of treatment to reduce criminal justice system involvement. By integrating
evidence-informed practices, criminal justice agencies and communities can save lives
and decrease costs associated deep-end criminal justice system and healthcare system
involvement.
