# PROMISING PRACTICES IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE: ASSISTING INDIVIDUALS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS

> There are currently an estimated 2.3 million individuals in U.S. prisons and jails, with 1.5 million meeting DSM-IV medical criteria for addiction (NIDA, 2014; CASA, 2010). Further, approximately 70 percent of state and 64 percent of federal inmates reported regular drug use prior to imprisonment; about 25 percent of violent offenders in state prisons committed their offenses under the influence of drugs (NIDA, 2014).
